# CS316: Databases Final Project
## Andrew Wu, Sanna Symer, Elizabeth Zhang, Shruthi Kumar, Karen Chen

This is our git repo for our CS316, Fall 2020 Final Project. The name of our project is DesolateWave Movie List (a name that was given to use by Heroku, and one which we kept in honor of all the challenges it gave us), and the purpose of our project was create a movie database that users can interact with. Our code was written via React (JS and CSS) and MySQLOur website uses OMDB API to store thousands to tens of thousands of movies (currently ~5600), displaying basic information about each movie for a user to see. Users can also favorite movies, set them as watched when they've viewed them, and can leave reviews while also reporting offensive ones for admin review. They can also view other users who use the website and friend them thus being able to see their profile, their favorites, and their reviews.

Our final project showcases a brief introduction, our thought process and how we started to come up with the schemas needed for our website and then followed by description of each page and how they were implemented and combined together for our final project. There's also a cute video where we do a quick runthrough of our website, showcasing all its various features, alerts, admin page, etc. Last but not least, we also talked about all the challenges and problems we had while doing this project before talking about our vision and future plans in developing this website. 

Thank you, 
Project Team 17
